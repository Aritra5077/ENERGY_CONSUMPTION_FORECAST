# ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_FORECAST
This project focuses on forecasting hourly energy consumption using historical energy generation data, weather condition &amp; time-based features. Precise forecasting is crucial for power grid management, cost efficiency &amp; preventing energy shortages. We experimented with multiple Machine &amp; Deep Learning models to identify the most effective approach.
